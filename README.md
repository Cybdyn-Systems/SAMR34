R34 stamp is designed around Microchipâ€™s ATSAMR34J18 SiP,  a 32-bit Arm Cortex-M0+ MCU (256Kb of Flash, 40Kb of RAM, 8kb of RWW flash) with an internal SX1276 LoRa transceiver. The SiP has a maximum power output of 20.00dBm, a frequency range of 862 to 1020MHz, and a 790nA sleep current.

This core is an arduino port for the Microchip ATSAMR34 Series microcontrollers - ATSAML21 with integrated SX1276 LoRa Tranceivers

## RIOT R34 Stamp setup
